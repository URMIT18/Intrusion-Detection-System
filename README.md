# Intrusion-Detection-System
An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a monitoring system that detects suspicious activities and generates alerts when they are detected in a pre defined dataset.
The application allows users to upload data from an Excel file, submit data through a form, and then compare the submitted data with the uploaded data.

Technologies Used for creation of Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

1.Flask: The web application is built using the Flask framework, which enables rapid development of web applications in Python.
2.PostgreSQL: The data is stored and managed in a PostgreSQL database, providing robustness and scalability.
3.Pandas: The Pandas library is used for reading and handling data from Excel files.
4.SQLAlchemy: The SQLAlchemy library is used to connect the Flask application with the PostgreSQL database and perform database operations.
5.psycopg2: The psycopg2 library is used for connecting to the PostgreSQL database and executing SQL queries.
6.HTML and CSS: The front-end of the application is developed using HTML for page structure and CSS for styling.
